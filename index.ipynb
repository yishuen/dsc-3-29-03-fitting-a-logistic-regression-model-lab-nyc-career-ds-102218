    "The stats model example we covered had four essential parts:\n",
    "    * Importing the data\n",
    "    * Defining X and y\n",
    "    * Fitting the model\n",
    "    * Analyzing model results\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding code to these four steps was:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from patsy import dmatrices\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "\n",
    "#Step 1: Importing the data\n",
    "salaries = pd.read_csv(\"salaries_final.csv\", index_col = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Step 2: Defining X and y\n",
    "y, X = dmatrices('Target ~ Age  + C(Race) + C(Sex)',\n",
    "                  salaries, return_type = \"dataframe\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#Step 3: Fitting the model\n",
    "logit_model = sm.Logit(y.iloc[:,1], X)\n",

    "Most of this should be fairly familiar to you; importing data with Pandas, initializing a regression object, and calling the fit method of that object. However, step 2 warrants a slightly more in depth explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dmatrices()` method above mirrors the R languages syntax. The first parameter is a string representing the conceptual formula for our model. Afterwards, we pass the dataframe where the data is stored, as well as an optional parameter for the formate in which we would like the data returned. The general pattern for defining the formula string is: `y_feature_name ~ x_feature1_name + x_feature2_name + ... + x_featuren_name`. You should also notice that two of the x features, Race and Sex, are wrapped in `C()`. This indicates that these variables are *categorical* and that dummy variables need to be created in order to convert them to numerical quantities. Finally, note that y itself returns a Pandas DataFrame with two columns as y itself was originally a categorical variable. With that, it's time to try and define a logistic regression model on your own! "
